# Instruction map

## Scope
Use this repository for Jekyll content, styles, and automation scripts related to the Unfinished Cemetery site.

## Canonical references

2. `/Users/jamiecraik/dev/unfinished-cemetery/AGENTS.md`
3. `/Users/jamiecraik/dev/unfinished-cemetery/docs/agents/*.md`

## Core rules
- Keep root guidance short and action-oriented.
- Link to detailed docs instead of duplicating long policy text.
- If two instructions conflict, stop and ask which one wins.
