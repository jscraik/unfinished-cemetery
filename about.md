    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    
    <p>
      I've abandoned dozens of projects. Each one carried shame. The shame accumulated. 
      I didn't talk about them. The pattern stayed invisible.
    </p>

    <p>
      The advice says "hide your failures." Show only your wins. Curate your portfolio. 
      But that's a lie of omission. The failures are where the learning lives.
    </p>

    <h2>The Ritual</h2>

    <p>
      This cemetery is a ritualized archive. Each "headstone" is a project that died — 
      but died with dignity. Each has:
    </p>

    <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      <li>A birth date (when it started)</li>
      <li>A death date (when it ended)</li>
      <li>A cause of death (why it ended)</li>
      <li>What it wanted to be (the vision)</li>
      <li>What it taught me (the lesson)</li>
      <li>An epitaph (the essence)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Public?</h2>

    <p>
      This is an <strong>anti-portfolio</strong>. Most portfolios show curated victories. 
      This shows curated failures — but failures as expertise.
    </p>

    <p>
      It signals: "I know what not to do." It inverts shame into authority. 
      It says I've been in the trenches, made mistakes, and learned from them.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Use This</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>For me:</strong> When I start a new project, I visit the cemetery. 
      I remind myself of the patterns that kill projects. I carry that awareness forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>For you:</strong> If you're a solo developer, maybe you have your own cemetery. 
      Maybe naming your dead projects helps you see the patterns. Maybe it doesn't. 
      This works for me.

    <h2>The Tech</h2>

    <p>
      This site is built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="page-link">Jekyll</a> 
      and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" class="page-link">GitHub Pages</a>. 
      The design is custom — dark, solemn, appropriate for a cemetery but professional.

      Each headstone is a Markdown file in <code>_headstones/</code>. 
      The layout and styling are in <code>_layouts/</code> and <code>assets/</code>.
