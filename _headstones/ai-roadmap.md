## What It Wanted To Be

An exhaustive, ordered curriculum for learning AI engineering. Every concept mapped, every resource linked, every dependency traced. A complete path from "what's a transformer" to "shipping production LLM systems."

I spent weeks researching, categorizing, sequencing. I built Notion databases with progress trackers. I curated papers, courses, codebases. I wanted to know the whole map before taking the first step.

## What Actually Happened

I planned more than I practiced. I optimized the learning path instead of learning. I collected resources instead of using them. The roadmap became a procrastination device — a way to feel productive without doing the hard work of actually building.

By the time I had the "perfect" curriculum, I had built nothing. And the field had moved on.

## Why It Died

**Theory trap.** Planning felt like progress. Researching felt like learning. Organizing felt like mastery. None of it was.

**The map is not the territory.** I wanted certainty before action. I wanted to know I wouldn't waste time on the "wrong" resource. But there's no wrong resource — only not building.

**Learning by building > building a learning plan.** Ralph Gold taught me this by accident. I didn't plan it. I just started. I learned by shipping broken code, not by reading about best practices.

## The Lesson

1. **Start before you're ready.** The first 20% of knowledge gets you 80% of capability. The rest comes from doing.

2. **Plans are for revising, not following.** A rigid roadmap is a liability in a fast-moving field. Build, then adjust.

3. **The best curriculum is the one you finish.** Perfect sequencing that you never execute is worse than messy execution.

## The Irony

The "AI Engineering Roadmap" I never finished? A dozen better ones have been published since. By people who shipped first and iterated.

Planning is not a substitute for doing.
