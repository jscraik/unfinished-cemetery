## What It Wanted To Be

gKit was meant to be a reusable governance layer for agent systems: policies, workflows, and automation that could be dropped into projects to make human + AI collaboration safer and more reliable.

## What Actually Happened

The system grew very quickly in scope: compliance overlays, pinned standards, oversight adapters, governance indices, and enterprise-grade checks.

It became a serious platform project — more infrastructure than a side project I could actively keep evolving.

## Why It Died

**Sustainability and complexity.**

As the framework matured, the maintenance burden and coordination overhead rose faster than the ability to keep it moving forward.

I reached the same conclusion as other high-friction projects: the value was real, but the tax to continue was higher than the value I could reliably extract.

## What It Taught Me

1. **Complex systems need owners, not just vision.** A governance framework is productized policy — if the operating cost is too high, it collapses quickly.
2. **Pick your ambition for your runway.** Broad guardrail systems are valuable, but they need sustained attention.
3. **Archiving is a hard decision well made.** Retirement is not failure when continuation threatens the integrity of the work.
