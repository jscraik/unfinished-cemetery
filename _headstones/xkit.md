## What It Wanted To Be

An unofficial toolkit for X's web API — a clean developer surface for automations and experiments that could ship without relying on brittle UI hacks.

## What Actually Happened

X changed its API policy. The new risk profile meant using the toolkit could expose people to account actions I couldn't control or defend against.

## Why It Died

**Policy risk.** The platform rules shifted in a way that could put user accounts at risk. I chose not to ship anything that might get people banned.

## What It Taught Me

1. **User safety beats feature velocity.** If the platform can hurt users, it can hurt your product too.
2. **Unofficial APIs are fragile.** If you can't rely on policy stability, you can't build trust.
3. **Know when to stop.** Some projects die because they *should*.
