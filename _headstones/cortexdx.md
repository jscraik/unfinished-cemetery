## What It Wanted To Be

A diagnostic layer for agent systems — health monitoring for AI cognition. Not just "did the agent succeed" but "is the agent functioning well." Metrics for coherence, drift, confidence calibration, error recovery.

The pitch: agents will need doctors too. CortexDx would be the first AI health platform.

## What Actually Happened

I built the prototype in a week. It worked. It detected patterns in agent traces that correlated with downstream failures. It could flag an agent heading for hallucination before it happened.

Then the brain fog hit. Hard.

Dysexecutive syndrome doesn't negotiate. For two weeks, I couldn't hold the architecture in my head. The code I had written looked foreign. The documentation read like another language. I couldn't remember why I had made the choices I made.

## Why It Died

**Doubt crept in during the fog.** When I couldn't understand my own code, I assumed it was bad code. When I couldn't hold the vision, I assumed the vision was flawed. The fog didn't kill the project — the fog killed my confidence in it.

And when the fog lifted? The doubt stayed. I couldn't look at CortexDx without seeing "that thing I couldn't understand."

**I didn't trust my own competence.** Even after recovery, I second-guessed every decision. I rewrote instead of refined. I questioned instead of shipped.

## The Lesson

1. **Health crises will distort judgment.** When cognition falters, everything looks wrong. Don't make decisions during the fog.

2. **Doubt outlasts symptoms.** The fog cleared in weeks. The doubt lingered for months. I needed external validation I never sought.

3. **Ship before the fog.** CortexDx was 80% done. Two more days and it would have been live. The fog hit at 80% — the most dangerous moment.

4. **Your past self is competent.** The code I couldn't read during fog? It was fine. I should have trusted the version of me who wrote it.

## Would I Revive It?

Maybe. The idea is still sound — agent health monitoring will be a category. But CortexDx carries too much weight now. It would need a fresh start, a new name, a clean slate.

Sometimes you can't rescue the project. You can only rescue the lesson.
